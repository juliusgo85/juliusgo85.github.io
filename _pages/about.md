Hi, my name is Julius Go. During the last few years working as a senior financial analyst, I've started to see how programming can make my job easier and provide deeper insights than the usual tools like Excel pivot tables and vlookups.

My eyes were opened to programming when I had to learn SQL and use PowerQuery to automate some of my monthly forecasting activities. Since then, I've been taking classes in Python, learning some of the packages available and experimenting on my own.

This site was made to share some of the projects I've been working on. Learning how to create this site (from a Jekyll theme template) has been super fun and adds a little extra motivation to learning.

Please share your thoughts with me on how I can improve the site. Thanks for reading!
