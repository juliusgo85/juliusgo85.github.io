## Making interactive charts with data from a website

If you practice BJJ, you probably hear about some competitors and teams winning all the time but how often do we look at their rankings over the years? Even if you're not participating in or following this very niche sport, it might give you some ideas or tools to do a similar analysis on another subject.

How I did it: To get the data, I did some web scraping from the IBJJF's Championships results page to get the individual year rankings. After cleaning up the data in pandas, I used Altair to plot the results for Men's, Women's, and Juvenile categories.
